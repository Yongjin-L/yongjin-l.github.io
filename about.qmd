<div class="h1">Hello! It’s nice to meet you</div>

Thanks for stopping by!

I work as a data scientist at the [Urban Health Lab](https://www.urbanhealthlab.org/) at the University of Pennsylvania. My research interests include applications of biomedical and spatial data science in the public and population health fields. 

My current projects use electronic health record (EHR) and geospatial data to explore how the neighborhood environment and access to urban nature can impact the health of individuals in Philadelphia. Learn more about my research interests in [publications](/publication).

Get in touch by [sending me a note](/contact.qmd)! {{< fa feather-pointed >}}
