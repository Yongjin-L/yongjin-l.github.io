I **explore, reflect, and create.** 

As an educator and researcher, I explore students’ and teachers’ experiences, reflect critically to bridge theory and practice, and create innovative solutions to enrich educational practice. 

My current work focuses on **Integrating AI for Reflective Practice and Systematic Review**, where I integrate philosophical inquiry, practical pedagogy, and innovative technologies.

If your goal is aligned to mine, please feel free to contact me.
