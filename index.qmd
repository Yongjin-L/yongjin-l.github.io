::: {#hero-heading}

I **“listen, reflect, and act.”** As an educator and researcher in physical education, I listen to students’ and teachers’ experiences, reflect critically to deepen understanding, and act through teaching, scholarship, and dissemination to enrich educational practice.

My current work focuses on **social and emotional learning in physical education**, where I integrate philosophical inquiry, practical pedagogy, and innovative technologies. My goal is to bridge theory, practice, and innovation to enhance the educational experiences of both teachers and students.
